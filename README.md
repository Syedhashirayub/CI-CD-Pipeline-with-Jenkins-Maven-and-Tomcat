## üìã Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup of an automated CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Maven**, and **Tomcat**, hosted on **AWS EC2** instances. It aims to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a Java web application using these DevOps tools.

The pipeline includes:
- Continuous Integration: Automatically build and test the application whenever a code change is pushed to the Git repository.
- Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy the built application to a Tomcat server.

## üõ†Ô∏è  Prerequisites‚öôÔ∏è

Before setting up the pipeline, ensure you have the following:
- AWS account with permission to create EC2 instances
- An EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2
- GitHub account for storing your project's source code

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Jenkins Installation and Setup

1. Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH and switch to the root user:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```

2. Update the system packages:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    ```

3. Install Jenkins:
    ```bash
    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    sudo yum install jenkins -y
    ```

4. Install Java 11 and start Jenkins:
    ```bash
    sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
    sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    ```

5. Configure Jenkins by opening your EC2 public IP with port `8080` in a browser:
    ```
    http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8080
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Maven Installation and Setup

1. Download and install Maven on the Jenkins server:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    cd /opt
    wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
    tar xzvf apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
    mv apache-maven-3.9.9 maven
    ```

2. Add Maven and Java to the system's PATH by editing the `.bash_profile`:
    ```bash
    vim ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    Add the following lines:
    ```bash
    M2_HOME=/opt/maven
    M2=/opt/maven/bin
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto.x86_64
    PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$M2_HOME:$M2
    ```

3. Apply the changes:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

4. Verify Maven installation:
    ```bash
    mvn -v
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tomcat Server Setup

1. Launch a new EC2 instance for Tomcat and allow inbound traffic on port `8080`.

2. Install Tomcat:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    cd /opt
    wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.76/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.76.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.76.tar.gz
    mv apache-tomcat-9.0.76 tomcat
    cd tomcat/bin
    ./startup.sh
    ```

3. Configure Tomcat manager by editing the `context.xml` files:
    ```bash
    vim /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
    vim /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
    ```
    Comment out the following lines:
    ```xml
    <!-- <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" ... /> -->
    ```

4. Restart Tomcat:
    ```bash
    ./shutdown.sh
    ./startup.sh
    ```

5. Add admin users to `tomcat-users.xml`:
    ```xml
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <role rolename="manager-script"/>
    <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script"/>
    ```

## üìú Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

1. Install Maven Integration and GitHub plugins in Jenkins.

2. Configure the Maven plugin in Jenkins:
    - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration**
    - Add JDK and Maven with paths `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto` and `/opt/maven` respectively.

3. Create a new Jenkins job:
    - Go to **New Item** > Enter a name (e.g., `BuildAndDeployToTomcat`) > Select `Freestyle project`.
    - In the **Source Code Management** section, add your GitHub repository link.
    - In the **Build** section, select the `pom.xml` file and run `clean install`.
    - Add a **Post-build Action** > Select `Deploy war/ear to a container` > Choose `Tomcat 8.x Remote` and enter your Tomcat server details.

---

## Automating the Pipeline with Poll SCM

1. Enable **Poll SCM** to automate the build and deploy process:
    - Go to **Build Triggers** in your Jenkins job.
    - Check the **Poll SCM** option and set the cron job to check for changes every minute:
      ```
      * * * * *
      ```

2. Every time there is a commit in the GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically trigger a build and deploy the latest version of the app to Tomcat.
